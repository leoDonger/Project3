# IK Simulation Project README

## Overview

This IK (Inverse Kinematics) Skeleton Simulation Project is an interactive 3D application developed in Processing. The simulation includes features like joint limits, dynamic obstacle interactions, user-interaction, moving IK, and 3D camera.

## Features

- **Multi-Arm IK**: Simulates multiple robotic arms with inverse kinematics.
- **Joint Limits**: Each joint has configurable limits to its range of motion.
- **IK Obstacles**: Interactive obstacles that the IK system can interact with and avoid.
- **User Interactions**: Includes various keyboard and mouse interactions for real-time control of the simulation.
- **Parital 3D Rendering and Camera**: Includes various keyboard and mouse interactions for real-time control of the simulation.
- **Moving IK**: Includes stiff and easy root moving.

## User Interactions

- **Mouse Drag**: Click and drag to move one of the obstacles within the simulation environment.
- **'N' Key**: Press to apply or cancel acceleration in the movement of the IK systems.
- **'T' Key**: Toggles the movement control between the left and right arm of the IK system.
- **'K' Key**: Initiates movement of the entire IK skeleton.
- **'L' Key**: Removes or reinstates joint limits, allowing for unrestricted movement of the joints.
- **'R' Key**: Resumes the system if it has been paused.
- **Space Key**: Pauses and unpauses the simulation.
