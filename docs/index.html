        <p>
            This IK (Inverse Kinematics) Simulation Project is an interactive 3D application developed in Processing. 
            The simulation includes features like joint limits, obstacle collision detection, 
            user-interaction, moving IK, and 3D rendering&camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          I encountered several <strong>difficulties</strong> during the development, such as applying obstacle collision  
          detection to the system simulation. I have spent too much time and tried a lot of different methods to pervent 
          the joints getting stuck in the obstacle, but none of them worked as perfectly as I expected. At the end, I settled with
          the methods from project 1.
          I have also tried to implement 3D render for the skeleton and Re-rooting IK for the system, but both failed after getting 
          no progress in solving the angle issue in processing.

            <h3 style="color: brown; font-size: large;">Camera Controls</h3>
            <strong>- Movement:</strong> Use 'q', 'w', 'e', 'a', 's', 'd' to navigate the camera location.  <br>
            <strong>- Speed up:</strong> Hold 'shift' to boost the move speed while using movement keys to raise or lower the camera's position.   <br>
            <strong>- Angle:</strong> Use the arrow keys 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right' to adjust the camera orientation.  <br>
            <br>
            <h3 style="color: brown; font-size: large;">Simulation Acceleration Cap Controls</h3>
            <strong>- Apply/Cancel acceleration cap:</strong> Press 'n' to activate or deactivate acceleration cap in the movement of the IK systems.  <br>
            <br>
            <h3 style="color: brown; font-size: large;">Skeleton Simulation Controls</h3>
            <strong>- Pause/Resume:</strong> Press 'Space' to toggle between pausing and resuming the simulation.   <br>
            <strong>- Reset:</strong> Hit 'r' to reset the simulation to its initial state. <br>
            <strong>- Left/Right Arn Switch:</strong> Press 't' to toggle the movement control between the left and right arm of the IK system. <br>
            <strong>- Walking/Moving root:</strong> Press 'k' to initiate movement of the entire IK skeleton. <br>
            <strong>- Cancel joint limit:</strong> Press 'l' to reinstate joint limits, allowing for unrestricted movement of the joints <br>
            <strong>- Camera Info:</strong> Press 'p' to print out the current camera location information. <br>
